Life Cycle or the steps in any Data Science Project:
1.  Understanding The Problem 
2.  Gathering Relevant Data
3.  Data Preparation & EDA (Data Analysis)
4.  Feature Engineering & Feature Extraction
5.   Model Building & Deployment

---------------------------------------------------

1.  Understanding the Problem
• Define the objectives clearly.
• Determine how to measure the project's success.
• Identify the problem type (e.g., classification, regression).

2.  Gathering Relevant Data
• Collect data from available sources.
• Ensure data is relevant to the problem.
• Consider the volume, variety, velocity, and veracity of the data.

3.  Data Preparation & EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
• Clean the data (handle missing values, remove duplicates).
• Perform exploratory analysis to understand the data.
• Normalize or scale the data if necessary.

4.  Feature Engineering & Feature Extraction
• Create new features that can help improve model performance.
• Reduce dimensionality if the feature space is too large.
• Select the most important features to be used for modeling.

5.  Model Building & Deployment
• Choose appropriate algorithms and train models.
• Validate model performance using cross-validation.
• Deploy the model for real-time use or batch processing.
