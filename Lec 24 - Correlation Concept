Correlation
Definition: Correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.

Formulas:

1. Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r):
r= n(Σxy) – (Σx)(Σy) / ν [ηΣx^2 - (Σx)²] [η Σy² - (Σy)²]
Where n is the number of pairs, 2 and y are the individual sample points indexed with i.

Concepts:
• Strength of Relationship: The correlation coefficient ranges from 1 to +1. A value close to +1 implies a strong positive relationship, close to -1 implies a strong negative relationship, 
and around 0 implies no linear relationship.
• Direction of Relationship: Indicates whether the variables increase together (positive) or as one increases, the other decreases (negative).

Real-life Use Case:
• Determining the relationship between consumer income and expenditure on luxury items.
• In finance, correlating different stock movements to diversify the portfolio

Correlation Matrix:

Types of Correlation Coefficients: 
1. Pearson Correlation Coefficient: Measures the linear relationship between two continuous variables. It assumes that the variables follow a normal distribution.
2. Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient: A non-parametric measure of rank correlation, assessing how well the relationship between two variables can be described using a monotonic function.
3. Kendall's Tau: Another rank-based correlation coefficient, often used for data with a natural ordinal classification.

Understanding a Correlation Matrix:
A correlation matrix displays correlation coefficients between sets of variables. Each cell in the matrix represents the correlation between two variables. The value ranges from -1 to +1, where:
• +1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship,
• -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship,
• O indicates no linear relationship.

Real-Life Use Cases
1. Finance: Correlation matrices are used to understand the relationships between different stocks or financial instruments, aiding in portfolio diversification.
2. Marketing: Analyzing customer data to find correlations between different buying behaviors.
3. Healthcare: Studying correlations between diffärent lifestyle factors and health outcomes.
