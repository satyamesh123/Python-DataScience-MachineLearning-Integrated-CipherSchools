• What is Data Visualization ?
  Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, 
  outliers, and patterns in data.
  This practice is crucial in the data science process, as it helps to make data more understandable and actionable for a wide range of users, from business professionals to data scientists.

• Choosing a type of Plot or Graph that is to be used to represent a particular data depends on:
  i - Use Cases.
  ii - Type of Data:
    •  Numerical.
    •  Categorical.

• Power Bi:
  Power BI is a Data Visualization and Business Intelligence tool by Microsoft that converts data from different data sources to create various business intelligence reports. Microsoft Power BI makes it easy for 
  businesses to spot trends, track performance, and make data-driven decisions.
