What is Al?
• Simulation of Human intelligence processes by machines.
                        Or
• It is the ability for a computer to think and learn.

Terms used in AI:
• Learning
• Reasoning
• Self-Correction

What is ML?
Machine learning is the subset of Al that uses statistical methods to allow machines to improve their results adth the amount of training data fed to it.
- Human Learning: Observations ➡ Learning ➡ Skills
- Machine Learning: Data ➡ Model/Predictor ➡ Predict

Types of AL:
• Supervised Learning: A Machine Learning model that works on Labeled set of data.
Labeled Data & Labels ➡ Machine ➡ ML Model ➡ Predictions

                                  Test Data

• Unsupervised Learning: A Machine Learning model that works on Unlabeled set of data. It works by analyzing the similar kinds of pattern in the data and classify them according to that.
DDCD ➡ Model ➡ DDDDD
CCDD             CCC

• Clustering: Grouping unlabeled examples based on similar instances is called clustering.

1. Email spam classification = Supervised Learning
2. Recommendation System = Both Supervised and Unsupervised
3. Cat-dog classification = Supervised Learning
4. Cat-dog Clustering = Unsupervised Learning
5. Playing alpha Go game = Both Supervised and Unsupervised

• Artificial Intelligrnce (1950s-1980s): Any technique which enables computers to mimic human behavior.
• Machine Learning (1980s-2010s): AI technique that give computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed to do so.
• Deep Learning (2010s....): A subset of ML which makes the computation of multi-layer nerursl networks feasible.

What is Data science?
• Data Science is a field of study involving statistical tools and techniques to extract meaningful insights from data.
• The data from which these insights are extracted can come from various sources, including databases, business transactions, sensors, and more. 
• Data science uses complex machine learning algorithms to build predictive models.
